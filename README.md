### Description

An explosive arcade game combining space invaders, bullet hell, some Vlambeer, and other influences. Plough through 13 waves and choose from 13 ship upgrades along the way. 

If there's one thing you do, make sure to jump into sandbox mode. It's a great way to get a taste for what the game offers and/or get to blowing stuff up quickly, especially if you're finding the normal waves too hard. Sandbox mode to puts you straight into the last (infinite) wave with a fully upgraded ship. 

### Controls

There are only two controls (in theory), left and right (or A/D, LMB/RMB). Hold both to confirm your selection of menu item. Tap both to activate and deactivate the ship's shield (available after a couple waves). 

Auxiliary controls: 
* Q to quit 
* P to pause/unpause 
* Enter/space to select menu item if holding down left and right is too much trouble
